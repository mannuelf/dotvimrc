# .vimrc

My vimrc file, so we can take it anywhere

## How to use

1. clone repo
2. delete your local .vimrc
3. symlink to this .vimrc and you should be good to go.
4. Instull plugins, I am using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```bash
ln -s $HOME/workspace/dotvimrc/.vimrc $HOME/.vimrc
```
